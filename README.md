# env

This repository contains my shell environment scripts and configurations. The layout is as follows:

* `bash/`: Files written for `bash`, mostly aimed at bootstrapping environments from the `root` user.
* `configs/`: Configuration files, such as for terminal programs, editors, and `tmux`.
* `fish/`: Files written for `fish`, my primary shell program.
* `pkgbuilds/`: My collection of PKGBUILD files for Arch Linux.
* `podman/`: My collection of container build files, mainly for use with `podman`.
* `python/`: My collection of Python scripts and projects.

## Support

You can take and use anything in this repo freely, as it is licensed under the MIT License. However, if you have any issues with using them, I do not provide any type of support, as I tailor everything in this repo entirely for my own set up and use cases. I have done my best to comment everything so it can easily be understood. I will accept pull requests if you feel something could be better!
