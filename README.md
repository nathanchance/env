# Scripts

These are my personal scripts for various tasks (which are talked about briefly at the top of every script).

Feel free to take and use as you see fit!

To build Clang, you will need to the following:

+ A Linux distribution (the script has been tested on Ubuntu 17.04 and Arch Linux)
+ A decent processor and RAM (i5 and 8GB of RAM or more is preferred)
+ Core developer packages
    + For Arch: the base-devel package should be enough
    + For Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install flex bison ncurses-dev texinfo gcc gperf patch libtool automake g++ libncurses5-dev gawk subversion expat libexpat1-dev python-all-dev binutils-dev libgcc1:i386 bc libcloog-isl-dev libcap-dev autoconf libgmp-dev build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib pkg-config libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev```
